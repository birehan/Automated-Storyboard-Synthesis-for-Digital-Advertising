# Automated Storyboard Synthesis for Digital Advertising - Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the backend of our cutting-edge machine learning solution developed as part of the 10 Academy Cohort A Weekly Challenge: Week 10. This backend system serves as the core engine behind our automated storyboard synthesis, providing APIs for processing textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets and generating visually compelling storyboards.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for receiving textual inputs and serving generated storyboards.
- **Text Processing**: Utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze and interpret advertisement descriptions.
- **Model Integration**: Incorporates machine learning models for synthesizing storyboards from textual inputs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally to handle a large number of concurrent requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Framework for building the backend server and RESTful APIs.
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn for implementing the storyboard synthesis models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries**: Libraries like NLTK or spaCy for text processing and analysis.

## Installation

To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/birehan/automated-storyboard-synthesis-backend.git`
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd automated-storyboard-synthesis-backend`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the Flask server: `python app.py`
5. The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints with textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets.
2. Receive JSON responses containing generated storyboards or error messages.
