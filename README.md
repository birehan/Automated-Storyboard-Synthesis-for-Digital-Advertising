# Automated Storyboard Synthesis for Digital Advertising

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a cutting-edge machine learning solution developed as part of the 10 Academy Cohort A Weekly Challenge: Week 10. The challenge focuses on automating the process of transforming textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into visually compelling storyboards, thereby revolutionizing the digital advertising industry.

## Business Objective

In response to recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, Adludio, a leading provider of online mobile advertising, aims to automate the end-to-end process of advertising production. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the objective is to significantly expedite the ideation and execution phases, enabling clients to swiftly launch their campaigns with minimal time and resource expenditure.
